            <li>VIT Bhopal University, Bhopal</li>
            <p>2020-2024</p>
            <p>
                My time at VIT Bhopal wasn't just about textbooks and exams it was a transformative journey that ignited my 
                passion for technology. Immersed in a vibrant academic environment, I delved deep into the fascinating world of 
                computers, spending countless hours honing my skills in web development, app development, Java, data structures 
                and algorithms (DSA), and more.
                <br>
                <br>
                Through challenging coursework and engaging projects, I learned to navigate the intricacies of coding, 
                building robust web applications and intuitive mobile apps. Mastering Java gave me a strong foundation in 
                object-oriented programming, while tackling DSA problems sharpened my analytical and problem-solving skills.

            <p>
                My formative years were enriched by the walls of CPS, where I delved deep into the fascinating realms 
                of physics, chemistry, and mathematics. These subjects weren't merely academic pursuits they became gateways to 
                understanding the universe's intricate lessons, the invisible forces shaping our world, and the elegant logic woven 
                into everything from the smallest atom to the vast expanses of space. Through rigorous study and passionate exploration, 
                I cultivated a keen understanding of these fundamental sciences, laying a strong foundation for my intellectual journey 
                and igniting a lifelong curiosity about the wonders that lie beyond the surface.
